#JerseyDoc

JerseyDoc is a Javadoc Doclet that generates documentation for Jersey based REST services.

It currently generates two types of output:

* audit - a .csv file listing out class and method names mapped to HTTP methods and service URLs. This is useful for sanity checking your services.
* full -  a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file containing full documentation of each service included example requests & responses and possible HTTP return codes. Tools such as [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) can be used to convert this output various formats such as HTML, PDF, ODF etc,

## Javadoc
For the most part JerseyDoc just uses the standard Javadoc in your resource classes. It currently supports one additional tag *@response.status* which can be used to specify the response status codes generated by the server.

See [here](https://github.com/rabidgremlin/JerseyDoc/blob/master/src/java/test/com/rabidgremlin/example/resources/TodoListResource.java) and [here](https://github.com/rabidgremlin/JerseyDoc/blob/master/src/java/test/com/rabidgremlin/example/resources/TodoResource.java) for examples of documented resources.

## Ant
The Doclet plays nicely with ant check out this [example build.xml](https://github.com/rabidgremlin/JerseyDoc/blob/master/src/ant/build.xml) file. The Doclet can also be run from the command line is need be.

## Getting started

1. Grab the source
2. run *ant* on the *build.xml* in the *build* folder
3. Switch to the *release/example/build* folder and run *ant*
4. Check out the generated documentation in *release/example/out*
5. Use the example project as a template for integrating JerseyDoc into your own projects

## Limitations

1. The tool is still a work in progress
2. Only JSON examples are currently generated
